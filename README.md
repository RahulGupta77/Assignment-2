## Problem: 
   ### In this assignment I had to build a Classification model using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raaavan/cottonleafinfection) dataset. 
   ### For Task 1, I have used my CPU to train the model but in Task 2, I used Google Colab for GPU access.
   
## Task 1
   ### Built a CNN model from scratch with a *val_Accuracy* of *86.88%* and used the same model for making predictions. 
   
## Task 2
   ### Built a model using transfer learning. Using VGG16 as a base model, achieved a *val_Accuracy* of *96.50%*
